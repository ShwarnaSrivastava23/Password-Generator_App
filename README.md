# Password-Generator_App
🚀 Built a Password Generator App using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite3! 🔐

Managing passwords securely is crucial in today’s digital world, so I built a simple Password Generator App that:
✅ Generates strong, random passwords
✅ Saves passwords securely in an SQLite database
✅ Allows users to view and delete saved passwords

Tech Stack: Python, Tkinter (GUI), SQLite3 (Database)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in GUI development, database handling, and Python scripting. Looking forward to adding encryption for extra security!
